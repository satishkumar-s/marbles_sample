#Marbles Part 1 - Demo

##BEFORE YOU RUN
- The underlying network for this application is the [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/docs), a Linux Foundation project.
- The expectations of this application are to test the JS SDK, guide its development and to aid a developer in becoming familiar with our SDK + chaincode.
- This is a `very simple` asset transfer demonstration.  Two users can create and exchange marbles with each other.
- There will be multiple parts. Part 1 and 2 are complete [2/15/2016]
- There are two components to this demo each with their own repo. The node.js web application and chaincode. The chaincode repo can be found here: [https://github.com/ibm-blockchain/marbles-chaincode](hhttps://github.com/ibm-blockchain/marbles-chaincode).  You are currently inside the node.js repo.

***

##Part 1 Goals
- User can create a marble and store it in the chaincode state
- User can read and display all marbles in the chaincode state
- User can transfer a marble to another user
- User can delete a marble
- Server pushes block/marble updates to client when a new block event has occurred
- Deployable on Bluemix

***

#Prereq:
1. Bluemix ID https://console.ng.bluemix.net/ (needed to create your IBM Blockchain network if local network is not setup)
1. If you want to run Marbles on a local blockchain network (ie. not using Bluemix) you will need to have completed the Hyperledger Fabric [development setup](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/Setup/Network-setup.md).
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 0.12.0+ and npm v2+ (only needed if you want to run the app locally, npm comes with node.js)
1. Node.js + express experience. Marbles is a very simple blockchain app but itâ€™s still a fairly involved node app.  **You should be comfortable with node** and the express module.
1. GoLang Environment (only needed to build your own chaincode, not needed if you just run the marbles app as is)
1. I highly recommend you complete [learn chaincode](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/learn-chaincode) first



#Application Background
Hold on to your hats everyone, this application is going to demonstrate transferring marbles between two users leveraging IBM Blockchain.
We are going to do this in Node.js and a bit of GoLang. 
The backend of this application will be the GoLang code running in our blockchain network. 
From here on out the GoLang code will be referred to as 'chaincode' or 'cc'. 
The chaincode itself will create a marble by storing it to the chaincode state. 
The chaincode itself is able to store data as a string in a key/value pair setup. 
Thus we will stringify JSON objects to store more complex structures. 

Attributes of a marble:

	1. name (unique string, will be used as key)
	1. color (string, css color names)
	1. size (int, size in mm)
	1. user (string)
	
We are going to create a Web UI that can set these values and pass them to the chaincode. 
Interacting with the cc is done with a HTTP REST call to a peer on the network. 
The ibc-js SDK will abstract the details of the REST calls away.
This allows us to use dot notation to call our GoLang functions (such as `chaincode.invoke.init_marble(args)`).

#Application Communication Flow

![](/doc_images/comm_flow.png)

1. The user will interact with our Node.js application in their browser.
1. This client side JS code will open a websocket to the backend Node.js application. The client JS will send messages to the backend when the user interacts with the site.
1. The backend Node.js will send HTTP requests (via the SDK) to a blockchain peer to carry out the user's actions.
1. The peer will communicate to its chaincode container at its leisure. Note that the previous HTTP request was really a 'submission' of chaincode to be run, it will actually run at a later date (usually milliseconds).
1. The cc container will carry out the desired operation and record it to the ledger. ie create/transfer a marble.

#Context Clues
There are 3 distinct parts/worlds that you need to keep straight. 
They should be thought of as isolated environments that communicate over HTTP. 
This walk through will jump from one to another as we setup and explain each part. 
It's important to identify which part is which. 
There are certain keywords and context clues to help you identify one from another.

1. The Chaincode Part - This is GoLang code that runs on/with a peer on your blockchain network. Also called `cc`. Anything blockchain happens here.
1. The Client Side JS Part - This is JavaScript code running in the user's browser. User interaction code happens here.
1. The Server Side JS Part - This is JavaScript code running our application's backend. ie `Node.js` code which is the heart of Marbles! Sometimes referred to as our `node` or `server` code. Functions as the glue between the user and our blockchain.

#Chaincode
To understand what is going on we need to start looking at the chaincode.  The complete cc code for this example can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles-chaincode/blob/master/hyperledger/part1/part1_chaincode.go). 
Marbles Part 1 and Marbles Part 2 will use different chaincode, but Part 2 will include everything from Part 1. 
Part 1 is just nicer to look at since it has less lines of code, and hopefully less things to confuse you on. 
It is perfectly fine to use Part 2's chaincode with the Marbles Part 1 web application.
	
The first interesting place in the cc is the `Invoke()` function. 
This is our entry point into chaincode. 
IE the peer will call this function for any type of "invocation". 
"Invoking" a function simply means we are attempting to run a cc function and that this event will be recorded to the blockchain ledger.
A counter example to an invoke operation would be a query operation.  Query events do not get recorded to the ledger.

Looking at the example code it should be clear that we can invoke our GoLang functions by detecting the desired function name and passing to that function the argument `args`.

__Invoke()__

```js
	// ============================================================================================================================
	// Invoke - Our entry point for Invocations
	// ============================================================================================================================
	func (t *SimpleChaincode) Invoke(stub *shim.ChaincodeStub, function string, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
		fmt.Println("invoke is running " + function)

		// Handle different functions
		if function == "init" {               //initialize the chaincode state, used as reset
			return t.Init(stub, "init", args)
		} else if function == "delete" {      //deletes an entity from its state
			return t.Delete(stub, args)
		} else if function == "write" {       //writes a value to the chaincode state
			return t.Write(stub, args)
		} else if function == "init_marble" { //create a new marble
			return t.init_marble(stub, args)
		} else if function == "set_user" {    //change owner of a marble
			return t.set_user(stub, args)
		}
		fmt.Println("invoke did not find func: " + function) //error

		return nil, errors.New("Received unknown function invocation")
	}
```

For example our cc code will detect when the variable `function` is equal to "write" and will call `t.Write()`.
The SDK we are using can parse and find the name of the functions listed in this `Invoke()` code. 
It will then give you a dot notation to use them in your Node.js application. ie:
	
```js
	chaincode.query.read(["abc"]);               //calls the Query() function which will read the var "abc"
	chaincode.invoke.write(["stuff", "test"]);    //invokes the cc function Write() function which will write test to "stuff" in the cc state
	chaincode.invoke.rule_the_world(["tomrrow"]); //invokes the cc function "rule_the_world" (assuming it exists)
```

For example in our node.js code if we call `chaincode.invoke.write()` it will generate a HTTP request to the peer which ultimately runs the `t.Write()` chaincode function.

Note that the `chaincode.query.read()` will call the `Query()` function in our chaincode. 
This function is not listed in `Invoke()` because it not an invocation. 
The code for my `Query()` and `read()` is listed below:

__Query()__

```js
	// ============================================================================================================================
	// Query - Our entry point for Queries
	// ============================================================================================================================
	func (t *SimpleChaincode) Query(stub *shim.ChaincodeStub, function string, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
		fmt.Println("query is running " + function)

		// Handle different functions
		if function == "read" {													//read a variable
			return t.read(stub, args)
		}
		fmt.Println("query did not find func: " + function)						//error

		return nil, errors.New("Received unknown function query")
	}
	
	// ============================================================================================================================
	// Read - read a variable from chaincode state
	// ============================================================================================================================
	func (t *SimpleChaincode) read(stub *shim.ChaincodeStub, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
		var name, jsonResp string
		var err error

		if len(args) != 1 {
			return nil, errors.New("Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting name of the var to query")
		}

		name = args[0]
		valAsbytes, err := stub.GetState(name)									//get the var from chaincode state
		if err != nil {
			jsonResp = "{\"Error\":\"Failed to get state for " + name + "\"}"
			return nil, errors.New(jsonResp)
		}

		return valAsbytes, nil													//send it onward
	}
```

The `read()` cc function gives us some insight to how variables are retrieved from cc state. 
It is a simple matter of using `stub.GetState()` to fetch the value from the key/value pair.
The return value of query is an array of bytes. 
This array gets passed to the peer's REST API code which will format it into a JSON string for the response. 
Please note that all chaincode must have a Query() function. 
I would suggest you simply copy this one if you plan to build your own cc. 


__Write()__

```js
	// ============================================================================================================================
	// Write - write variable into chaincode state
	// ============================================================================================================================
	func (t *SimpleChaincode) Write(stub *shim.ChaincodeStub, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
		var name, value string
		var err error
		fmt.Println("running write()")

		if len(args) != 2 {
			return nil, errors.New("Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting 2. name of the variable and value to set")
		}

		name = args[0]                            //rename for funsies
		value = args[1]
		err = stub.PutState(name, []byte(value))  //write the variable into the chaincode state
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		return nil, nil
	}
```

The `Write()` function is equally simple but unlike query, write is found in our `Invoke()` function. 
`Write()` uses `stub.PutState(name, value)` to store the key/value pair. 
Note that the name is a string, and that value is an array of bytes. 

Most of the chaincode we will create will mimic parts of read or parts of write. 
What I mean by that is that we will use `PutState()` and `GetState()` as the basic building blocks for any cc functions we need to create. 
Marbles is going to use something that I'm going to call a "monolithic chaincode model". 
It just means we will have 1 chaincode for the entire app. 
Individual marbles and anything else we need will live inside this single chaincodeâ€™s state space. 
Of course there are much more complicated architectures you can create with a blockchain network. 
I wanted to start here with the simplest one I could think of. 
We will take a look at writing more specific chaincode after we get an environment setup. 

**A slightly more comprehensive chaincode tutorial can be found at [Learn Chaincode](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/learn-chaincode)**

# Setup Options:
So the cc is great and all but first we need a blockchain network. 
Choose 1 option below:

(1) Deploy the app and network at once on Bluemix.  Simply click this button &nbsp;&nbsp; 
[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/ibm-blockchain/marbles.git)
then continue [here](#use).

`OR`

(2) Deploy the app on my local machine, connecting to a Bluemix IBM Blockchain network - [instructions](#manbluenetwork)

`OR`

(3) Deploy the app wherever and connect to a local/remote Hyperledger Network - [instructions](#confignetwork)

# <a name="manbluenetwork"></a>Manual Bluemix Network:
Don't fret, "manual" setup means I will guide you to click on a particular button and fill out a text input field or two. 
There is a Bluemix tile that will create you your own personal blockchain network. 
All you have to do is find the tile and give the network a name. 

1. First login to [Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net)
1. Click the "Catalog" link on the top navigation bar

![](/doc_images/bluemix_ibc1.png)

1. Find and click the "Blockchain" tile. You can use the navigation on the left to filter the list: "Services" > "Web and Application" or type `blockchain` in the search box.

![](/doc_images/bluemix_ibc2.png)

1. Choose any space from the "Space:" dropdown (dealers choice)
1. Leave the "App:" field as "Leave unbound" (unless you already have an application, but you probably don't yet)
1. Change the "Service name" to "myblockchain" without the quotes
1. Leave the "Credential name" field as its default value
1. Leave the "Selected Plan" as its default value
1. Click the "CREATE" button

![](/doc_images/bluemix_ibc3.png)

1. If all goes well you should be on the manage screen for your new service. Click the "LAUNCH" button to see the dashboard for your network. 
	- You should see a few peers listed in the first table
	- From here you can monitor if your peers crash, if the chaincode containers are running, and view logs for all

![](/doc_images/bluemix_ibc4.png)

![](/doc_images/bluemix_ibc5.png)

(Note if you find yourself on the main Bluemix Dashboard and want to get back to this service screen just click the tile name "myblockchain" in the "Services" section)

The network is all setup.  **Now we need to copy the peer data and pass it to our marbles node.js application** (only need this step if we run the app locally).

1. Go back to your Bluemix Dashboard page
1. Click the "myblockchain" tile in you Bluemix Dashboard
1. Click the "Service Credentials" link on the left
1. Copy the value of the whole JSON object to the `mycreds.json` file in the root of this project.
	1. If for some reason you don't see any credentials click the "ADD CREDENTIALS" button and let the page refresh

1. continue by [running the marbles app](#runlocal)

#<a name="confignetwork"></a>Configure the SDK for your Blockchain Network
The app is setup to either grab network configuration data from Bluemix via VCAP Service's environmental variable OR to load the hard coded list in `mycreds.json`. 

- If you are running the app locally it will not find VCAP. Thus you need to edit `mycreds.json` 
- If you are hosting the app on Bluemix, but wish to use a different network you need to edit `mycreds.json`
- If you are hosting the app on Bluemix, and wish to use a Bluemix network you do not need to touch `mycreds.json`
	- Simply "bind" the Bluemix service to your application using the Bluemix's dashboard UI. [Binding Instructions](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/reqnsi.html#add_service)

Marbles is already coded to toggle the SDK between VCAP_SERVICES and `mycreds.json` depending on the environment.
All we have to do is populate `mycreds.json` with information about our network.
If you want more details of setup options then take a look at the [SDK's documentation](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/ibm-blockchain-js).
Below is a sample showing the information that must be in the JSON file. 

You may see other example JSON files that include much more information. 
Those extra fields are either legacy or simply extra. 
You only need to set the fields that are in the sample below:

__sample mycreds.json__

```js
{
  "credentials": {
    "peers": [
      {
        "api_host": "12345678-abcde-_vp0.blockchain.ibm.com",   //hostname or ip of peer
        "api_port_tls": 443,                                    //https port (optional)
        "api_port": 80,                                         //http port
        "id": "12345678-abcde-4d6f-_vp0"                        //unique id of peer
      }
    ],
    "users": [
      {
        "enrollId": "user_type1_1234567890",                     //enroll username
        "enrollSecret": "1234567890"                             //enroll's secret
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You must have the same number of entries in the `peer` array as the `users` array unless the network does not use Membership Services. 
You can omit the `users` array entirely if the network does not use Membership Services. 
Marbles only talks to 1 peer so you only need 1 peer in the array. 
You can omit the field `api_port_tls` if the network does not support TLS. 
If you are not using TLS you should also change the `options.tls` field to `false` on [line 200](app.js#L200) of app.js.
All networks created with the Bluemix service will have Membership Services and support TLS exclusively.
Once you have edited `mycreds.json` you are ready to run Marbles.

#<a name="runlocal"></a>Run Marbles on Local Machine
Now we are ready to work on the application! 

1. To run the app locally we need to get these files onto your machine
	- If you have Git installed then browse a command prompt/terminal to a desired working directory and type `git clone https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles`
		- Follow any login prompts with your GitHub account
	- If you do not have Git then [download the zip](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles/archive/master.zip) and extract it in your desired working directory.
1. Next we need to install our dependencies. Open a command prompt/terminal and browse to the root of this project.
1. In the command prompt type:
	
		> npm install gulp -g
		> npm install
		
1. [Configure](#confignetwork) the SDK to use your preferred blockchain network. Jump back here when finished.

1. Get back to your command prompt and browse to the root of this project. Run Marbles with the command:
	
		> gulp

1. If all goes well you should see this message in the console:
	
		--------------------------------- Server Up - localhost:3000 ------------------------------------
		
1. The app is already coded to auto deploy the chaincode.  You should see further message about it deploying.
 **[IMPORTANT]** You will need to wait about 60 seconds for the cc to fully deploy. The SDK will do the waiting for us by stalling our callback.
 
1. Once you see this message you are good to go: 
		
		[ibc-js] Deploying Chaincode - Complete
		---------------------------------------- Websocket Up ------------------------------------------

1. Continue by [using the marbles app](#use)
		
#Run Marbles on Bluemix (command line)
1. This app is already ready to run on Bluemix
1. If you don't already have one, create a new network for the app
1. Edit manifest.yml 
	- change the service name to match your network's service name, or remove the line if you don't want the app to bind to the service
	- change the app name and host name since "marbles" is taken
1. Push the application by opening a command prompt and browsing to this directory
	
	
	> cf login  
	> (follow the prompts)  
	> cf push YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE  
	
1. The application will bind to the service "myblockchain" and grab the peer data from VCAP_SERVICES. Code for this is in [app.js](app.js#L153)

#<a name="use"></a>Use Marbles App
1. Open up your browser and browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or your Bluemix www route.
1. You should be staring at our Marbles Part 1 application
	- Part 2 can be found at [http://localhost:3000/p2](http://localhost:3000/p2), but lets stay on Part 1 for now  
1. Finally we can test the application. Click the "Create" link on the top navigation bar
1. Fill out all the fields, then click the "Create" button
1. It should have flipped you back to "Home" and you should see that a new marble has been created
	- If not click the "Home" tab again or refresh the page
1. Next letâ€™s trade a marble.  Click and drag one marble from one person's list to another. It should temporary disappear and then auto reload the marbles in their new state. 
	- If not refresh the page



#SDK / IBM Blockchain Deeper Dive
Before we examine how marbles works letâ€™s examine what the SDK did to get our cc onto the network.
The options argument for `ibc.load(options)` contains many important things. 
An abbreviated version is below:

```js
	//note the marbles code will populates network.peers & network.users from VCAP Services (an env variable when running the app in Bluemix)
	var options = 	{
		network:{
			peers:   [{
				"api_host": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
				"api_port": "xxxxx",
				"api_url": "http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxxx"
				"id": "xxxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_vpx",
			}],
			users:  [{
				"enrollId": "user1",
				"enrollSecret": "xxxxxxxx"
			}]
		},
		chaincode:{
			zip_url: 'https://github.com/ibm-blockchain/marbles-chaincode/archive/master.zip', //http/https of a link to download zip
			unzip_dir: 'marbles-chaincode-master/hyperledger/part2',                                       //name/path to folder that contains the chaincode you want to deploy (path relative to unzipped root)
			git_url: 'https://github.com/ibm-blockchain/marbles-chaincode/hyperledger/part2',              //GO get https URL. should point to the desired chaincode repo AND directory
		}
	};
	ibc.load(options, cb);
```

This network has membership security; we can tell because there are enroll IDs/secrets in the `network.users` array. 
This means the peers will be expecting a validated `enrollId` on most API requests. 
Therefore, the first step is we need to use the /registrar API endpoint to register an `enrollId`. 
This creates a binding of sorts between the ID and the peer such that this `enrollId` cannot be used on any other peer. 
It's relatively safe to think of this step as registering an API key with a particular peer. 
The SDK does almost all the work here for us. 
It will first parse `network.peers[]` and `network.users[]` and run 1 POST /registrar HTTP request per peer. 
It will send the first `enrollId` to the first peer, and the second ID to the second peer and so on until every peer has 1 ID. 
The details of all rest calls are taken care of by the SDK but if you are curious we have [Swagger Documentation](https://obc-service-broker-prod.mybluemix.net/swagger) on the IBM Blockchain peer APIs. 
At the end of this step we are ready to deploy our chaincode. 

Before we deploy though, the SDK will download and parse the chaincode. 
This is when it builds up the dot notation we can use to ultimately call cc functions from JS. 
Once itâ€™s done downloading/parsing it runs the deploy HTTP request. 
We should receive a hash in the response that is unique to this chaincode. 
This hash will be used along with the registered `enrollId` in all future invocations / queries against this cc. 


#Marbles Deeper Dive
Hopefully you have successfully traded a marble or two between users. 
Letâ€™s look at how this was done by starting at the chaincode.

__set_user()__

```js
	type Marble struct{
		Name string `json:"name"`
		Color string `json:"color"`
		Size int `json:"size"`
		User string `json:"user"`
	}

	// ============================================================================================================================
	// Set User Permission on Marble
	// ============================================================================================================================
	func (t *SimpleChaincode) set_user(stub *shim.ChaincodeStub, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
		var err error
		
		//   0       1
		// "name", "bob"
		if len(args) < 2 {
			return nil, errors.New("Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting 2")
		}
		
		fmt.Println("- start set user")
		fmt.Println(args[0] + " - " + args[1])
		marbleAsBytes, err := stub.GetState(args[0])
		if err != nil {
			return nil, errors.New("Failed to get thing")
		}
		res := Marble{}
		json.Unmarshal(marbleAsBytes, &res)       //un stringify it aka JSON.parse()
		res.User = args[1]                        //change the user
		
		jsonAsBytes, _ := json.Marshal(res)
		err = stub.PutState(args[0], jsonAsBytes) //rewrite the marble with id as key
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		
		fmt.Println("- end set user")
		return nil, nil
	}
```

This `set_user()` function takes in an array of strings argument. 
Within the array the first index should have the name of the marble key/value pair. 
We retrieve the marble's struct with `stub.GetState(args[0])` and then unmarshal it into a Marble structure. 
From there we can index into the structure with `res.User` and overwrite the marble's owner with the new username.
Next we Marshal the structure back up so that we can use `stub.PutState()` to overwrite the marble with its new details. 

This is a `very` simplistic way to change ownership of an asset. 
The concept of an "owner" is simply the value of a string inside the marble's structure. 
We will explore more sophisticated methods in Marbles Part 3.


Lets take 1 step up and look at how this chaincode was called from our node.js app. 

__/utils/ws_part1.js__

```js
	module.exports.process_msg = function(ws, data){
		if(data.v === 1){
			if(data.type == 'create'){
				console.log('its a create!');
				if(data.name && data.color && data.size && data.user){
					chaincode.invoke.init_marble([data.name, data.color, data.size, data.user], cb_invoked);
				}
			}
			else if(data.type == 'get'){
				console.log('get marbles msg');
				chaincode.query.read(['_marbleindex'], cb_got_index);
			}
			else if(data.type == 'transfer'){
				console.log('transfering msg');
				if(data.name && data.user){
					chaincode.invoke.set_user([data.name, data.user]);
				}
			}
		...
```

The `chaincode.invoke.set_user([data.name, data.user]);` line is where we submit our request to run the chaincode function. 
It is passing to our GoLang `set_user` function an array of strings argument containing the name of the marble and the name of its new owner. 
By "passing" I mean it is really sending a HTTP POST `/chaincode` invoke request to one of the peers in our network. 
This peer will in turn call the chaincode and actually pass the argument to the cc function. 
The details of which peer and the exact rest call are taken care of in our ibc-js SDK. 
For your own curiosity the details of the Invoke API call can be found [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/API/CoreAPI.md#chaincode)
This code itself was called in response to a websocket message that originated on our user's browser.

Pretty simple, now lets look 1 more step up to how we sent this websocket message.

__/public/js/part1.js__

```js
	$("#user2wrap").droppable({drop:
		function( event, ui ) {
			var user = $(ui.draggable).attr('user');
			if(user.toLowerCase() != bag.setup.USER2){
				$(ui.draggable).addClass("invalid");		//make the marble transparent to reflect a pending action
				transfer($(ui.draggable).attr('id'), bag.setup.USER2);
			}
		}
	});

	...

	function transfer(marbleName, user){
		if(marbleName){
			console.log('transfering', marbleName);
			var obj = 	{
							type: "transfer",

							user: user,

			ws.send(JSON.stringify(obj));
			showHomePanel();
		}
	}
```

We used jQuery and jQuery-UI to implement the drag and drop functionality. 
With these tools we get a droppable event trigger. 
In the above code we have attached it to #user2wrap and #user1wrap div elements. 
When the event fires we first check to see if this marble actually moved owners, or if it was just picked up and dropped back down. 
If its owner has changed we go off to the `transfer()` function.
This function creates a JSON message with all the needed data and uses our websocket to send it with `ws.send()`.

__Monitor-Blockheight__

Our Node.js SDK has a handy function called. `monitor_blockheight(cb)`. 
To use it we just pass it what function we want to be called whenever the SDK notices a new block has been written to the network. 
The plan is to use this event as a trigger to redraw the marble states. 

The Plan:

1. User trades a marble
1. At some point that event will be written to a block
1. The SDK detects a new block has been written
1. Letâ€™s assume this new block contains our user's trade action, therefore letâ€™s read all marble states
1. Broadcast the marble states to any connected websockets
1. Clients (aka browsers) receive the new marble states and redraw them

__./app.js__ (abbreviated)

```js
	// ========================================================
	// Monitor the height of the blockchain
	// ========================================================
	ibc.monitor_blockheight(function(chain_stats){
		if(chain_stats && chain_stats.height){
			console.log('hey new block, lets refresh and broadcast to all');
			ibc.block_stats(chain_stats.height - 1, cb_blockstats);
			wss.broadcast({msg: 'reset'});
			chaincode.query.read(['_marbleindex'], cb_got_index);
			chaincode.query.read(['_opentrades'], cb_got_trades);
		}
		
		//got the block's stats, lets send the statistics
		function cb_blockstats(e, stats){
			if(e != null) console.log('error:', e);
			else {
				if(chain_stats.height) stats.height = chain_stats.height - 1;
				wss.broadcast({msg: 'chainstats', e: e, chainstats: chain_stats, blockstats: stats});
			}
		}
		
		//got the marble index, lets get each marble
		function cb_got_index(e, index){
			if(e != null) console.log('error:', e);
			else{
				try{
					var json = JSON.parse(index);
					for(var i in json){
						console.log('!', i, json[i]);
						chaincode.query.read([json[i]], cb_got_marble);
					}
				}
				catch(e){
					console.log('marbles index msg error:', e);
				}
			}
		}
		
		//call back for getting a marble, lets send a message
		function cb_got_marble(e, marble){
			if(e != null) console.log('error:', e);
			else {
				try{
					wss.broadcast({msg: 'marbles', marble: JSON.parse(marble)});
				}
				catch(e){
					console.log('marble msg error', e);
				}
			}
		}
		...
	}
```

So this code is using the SDK's function `monitor_blockheight()`. 
Itâ€™s a pretty straight forward function in that its only argument is a callback function you want called when the SDK notices a new block. 
Our code then goes off and starts 4 things.

1. It fires off a request to the peer to read the block's stats
1. It sends a reset UI message to all clients through the websocket
1. It fires off a request to the cc to read marble index and then reads each marble
1. It fires off a request to the cc to read the open trades (used in Part 2)

The results will then be sent to the clients via the websocket (in individual messages). 
One more small note is about this line `stats.height = chain_stats.height - 1;`. 
We subtract 1 because the API `/chain` tells me the number of blocks.
But the API `/chain/blocks/<block #>` takes the id of a block which is indexed to 0.
So if we want details on blockheight #5, we build a request for `/chain/blocks/4`.


Thatâ€™s it! Hope you had fun trading some marbles in part 1. 
Next up is [Marbles Part 2](./tutorial_part2.md). 
Part 2 adds some new chaincode functions making it a little niftier.
